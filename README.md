# Project A.L.I.E.N. <br> (Autonomous Labyrinth Investigator, Explorer, Navigator)

## Introduction

For this project, as part of the
[Robotics Design and Construction](https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ELE00098H)
module at the University of York, the task was to design and build a robot that
could autonomously navigate a maze.

As I work on this project I will add more to this repository.

At the moment, all the code and design files are split up into different
repositories.
